Start
step 1 -> Declare variable: sentence_length,
step 2 -> initialize sentence_length to 0
step 3 -> read the input sentence as a string that end with point "."
step 4 -> iterate through each character of the sentence.
step 5 -> increament sentence_length by 1 for each character.
step 6 -> print sentence_length
Stop

Start
step 1 -> Declare varaiable: wordCount
step 2 -> initialize wordCount to 0
step 3 -> read input sentence as a string that end with point '.'
step 4 -> initialize wordCorrect to false (this variable indicate that character is part of word )  
step 5 -> iterate through each word of the sentence
step 6 -> increment by 1 if character = ' ' wordCorrect is true else wordCorrect is false when character != ' '.
step 7 -> print wordCount
Stop

Start
step 1 -> Declare vraiable: vowelCount
step 2 -> initialize vowelCount to 0
step 3 -> read througn input sentence as a string
step 4 -> Define set of vowel (a, e, i ,o, u).
step 5 -> iterate through each character in the sentence
step 6 -> if the character is vowel increament vowelCount by 1, else iterate to the end of sentence.
